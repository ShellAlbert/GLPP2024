create_clock -name {rd_clk_i} -period 40 [get_ports rd_clk_i] originating in instance buffering_FIFO was removed because it is defined at a clock input pin of the IP. User constraints should ensure the corresponding top-level port is correctly constrained at the top-level. If kept it may cause incorrect slack calculation.

create_clock -name {wr_clk_i} -period 40 [get_ports wr_clk_i] originating in instance buffering_FIFO was removed because it is defined at a clock input pin of the IP. User constraints should ensure the corresponding top-level port is correctly constrained at the top-level. If kept it may cause incorrect slack calculation.

set_false_path -through [get_pins lscc_fifo_dc_inst/rst_i] originating in instance buffering_FIFO was updated to set_false_path -through [get_pins {taskSchedule/buffering_FIFO/lscc_fifo_dc_inst/rst_i }] and kept.

set_false_path -through [get_pins lscc_fifo_dc_inst/rp_rst_i] originating in instance buffering_FIFO was updated to set_false_path -through [get_pins {taskSchedule/buffering_FIFO/lscc_fifo_dc_inst/rp_rst_i }] and kept.
